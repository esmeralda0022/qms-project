# QuailtyMed Missing Features Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for missing features and bug fixes in the QuailtyMed Healthcare Quality Management System. The analysis reveals several critical gaps between documented features and actual implementation.

## Architecture

The QuailtyMed system follows a **monolithic architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Frontend - HTML/CSS/JS] --> B[PHP API Layer]
    B --> C[MySQL Database]
    B --> D[File Storage System]
    E[Role-Based Access Control] --> B
    F[Session Management] --> B
    G[Audit Trail System] --> C
```

### Current Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: PHP 7.4+ with PDO
- **Database**: MySQL 5.7+
- **Authentication**: Session-based with bcrypt
- **File Storage**: Server-side with UUID naming

## Missing Features Analysis

### 1. User Management System (Critical)

**Current State**: No user management interface exists
**Documentation Claims**: "Navigate to user management (to be implemented in full version)"

#### Required Components:
- User creation/editing forms
- Role assignment interface  
- Department assignment
- User activation/deactivation
- Password reset functionality

### 2. Advanced User Interface Components

**Missing Frontend Elements**:
- Asset creation/management forms
- Maintenance scheduling interface
- NCR management screens
- Advanced reporting filters
- User profile management

### 3. API Endpoints Gaps

**Missing Backend APIs**:
- `api/users.php` - Complete user CRUD operations
- `api/assets.php` - Asset management endpoints
- `api/maintenance.php` - PM scheduling APIs
- `api/ncrs.php` - NCR management endpoints
- Enhanced reporting endpoints

### 4. Database Integration Issues

**Current Problems**:
- Hardcoded asset ID in checklist creation
- Missing asset selection UI
- No maintenance schedule automation
- Limited NCR workflow implementation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core User Management (Priority: Critical)

#### 1.1 Backend API Implementation

Create comprehensive user management API:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Admin Interface
    participant API as Users API
    participant DB as Database
    participant Auth as Auth System

    UI->>API: POST /api/users.php (Create User)
    API->>Auth: Validate Admin Permission
    Auth-->>API: Permission Granted
    API->>DB: Insert User Record
    DB-->>API: User Created
    API->>DB: Log Audit Trail
    API-->>UI: Success Response
```

**Required Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/users.php` - List all users with pagination
- `POST /api/users.php` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users.php?id=X` - Update user details
- `DELETE /api/users.php?id=X` - Deactivate user
- `POST /api/users.php?id=X&action=reset_password` - Password reset

#### 1.2 Frontend User Management Interface

**User Management Dashboard Components**:
- User listing table with search/filter
- Add/Edit user modal forms
- Role assignment dropdowns
- Department association
- Bulk actions (activate/deactivate)

#### 1.3 Role-Based Access Control Enhancement

**Permission Matrix Implementation**:
| Feature | Super Admin | Admin | Auditor | Dept Manager | Technician | Viewer |
|---------|-------------|-------|---------|--------------|------------|--------|
| User Management | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Asset Management | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Schedule PM | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Create Checklists | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

### Phase 2: Asset Management System (Priority: High)

#### 2.1 Asset CRUD Operations

**Asset Management Architecture**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Asset Types] --> B[Individual Assets]
    B --> C[Maintenance Schedules]
    B --> D[Checklists]
    C --> E[PM Records]
    D --> F[Inspection Records]
```

**Required Components**:
- Asset registration forms
- Equipment hierarchy management
- Maintenance history tracking
- Calibration scheduling
- Asset search and filtering

#### 2.2 Asset Selection Integration

**Problem**: Currently uses hardcoded asset ID = 1
**Solution**: Dynamic asset selection in checklist creation

### Phase 3: Maintenance Scheduling (Priority: High)

#### 3.1 Preventive Maintenance Automation

**Scheduling Logic**:
- Automatic schedule generation based on frequency
- Due date calculations and notifications
- Overdue PM tracking
- Maintenance history logging

#### 3.2 Dashboard Enhancement

**Real-Time Metrics**:
- Overdue PMs counter (currently shows static "3")
- Pending checklists (currently shows static "12")
- Compliance rate calculation (currently shows static "94%")
- Open NCRs tracking (currently shows static "5")

### Phase 4: Non-Conformance Reports (NCR) Enhancement (Priority: Medium)

#### 4.1 NCR Workflow Implementation

**Current State**: Auto-creates NCR records but no management interface
**Required**: Complete NCR lifecycle management

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Open : Failed Checklist Item
    Open --> InProgress : Assign CAPA
    InProgress --> UnderReview : Submit Evidence
    UnderReview --> Closed : Accept Resolution
    UnderReview --> InProgress : Request Changes
    Closed --> [*]
```

#### 4.2 CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Actions) Management

**Required Components**:
- Root cause analysis forms
- Corrective action assignment
- Evidence submission interface
- Effectiveness verification
- Closure approval workflow

### Phase 5: Advanced Reporting (Priority: Medium)

#### 5.1 Dynamic Report Generation

**Current Limitations**: Static sample reports
**Enhancement**: Real-time data-driven reports

**Report Types**:
- Compliance trends over time
- Department-wise performance
- Asset reliability metrics
- NCR analysis and trends
- Audit trail reports

#### 5.2 Report Customization

**Features**:
- Date range filtering
- Department/asset filtering
- Export format options (PDF, CSV, Excel)
- Scheduled report generation
- Email distribution
